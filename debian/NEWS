grml-etc-core (0.3.62) unstable; urgency=low

  * Merged /etc/skel/.zshrc into /etc/zsh/zshrc:

    Starting with grml-etc-core 0.3.62 grml's zsh setup lives only in
    *one* zshrc file - that is the global one: /etc/zsh/zshrc
    /etc/skel/.zshrc still exists but provides commented examples only.
    It is best to leave the /etc/skel/.zshrc file untouched and do
    personal changes to the setup via ${HOME}/.zshrc.local (as before)
    which is loaded at the end of the global zshrc.

    That way, we enable people on other operating systems to use our
    setup, too, just by copying our global zshrc to their ${HOME}/.zshrc.
    Adjustments would still go to the .zshrc.local file.
    Further information is available in the grml-zsh-refcard, available
    at http://grml.org/zsh/

grml-etc-core (0.3.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Please notice, that the setup of zsh's completion functions has
    been changed. The setup has been cleaned up but as a sideeffect
    you might notice a problem like:

     "_tags:comptags:67: can only be called from completion function"

    when starting zsh. The reason for this change is because the files
    inside /etc/zsh/completion.d/ have been renamed from 'foo' to
    '_foo' and their content has been adjusted according to the new
    setup too. If you added functions to completion.d yourself, please
    consider moving them to /etc/zsh/functions.d/. Files in that
    directory, not starting with an underscore are marked for
    automatic loading by default (so that is quite convenient).

    So to avoid above error message make sure you don't have any
    dpkg-files *not* starting with a '_' in /etc/zsh/completion.d/
    laying around. If there are files *not* starting with an
    underscore from an older grml-etc-core in completion.d, you may
    safely remove them.

grml-etc-core (0.1-31) unstable; urgency=low

  * Please notice, that the behaviour of global aliases in /etc/skel/.zshrc
    has been changed. Now global aliases won't be expanded automatically
    anymore. You can still use them (and even some more now as well),
    just type the abbreviation/global alias and expand it via pressing
    the key sequence ',.'. Usage example:

    % ls G<press-',.'-here>

    expands to:

    % ls |& grep --color=auto

    Thanks for the contribution, Matthias Kopfermann!
