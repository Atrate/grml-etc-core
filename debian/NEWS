grml-etc-core (0.1-31) unstable; urgency=low

  * Please notice, that the behaviour of global aliases in /etc/skel/.zshrc
    has been changed. Now global aliases won't be expanded automatically
    anymore. You can still use them (and even some more now as well),
    just type the abbreviation/global alias and expand it via pressing
    the key sequence ',.'. Usage example:

    % ls G<press-',.'-here>

    expands to:

    % ls |& grep --color=auto

    Thanks for the contribution, Matthias Kopfermann!
