## skel/.zshrc on grml systems
#
# Nowadays, grml's zsh setup lives in only in *one* zshrc file.
# That is the global one: /etc/zsh/zshrc (from grml-etc-core).
# It is best to leave this file untouched and do personal changes to
# the setup via ${HOME}/.zshrc.local which is loaded at the end of the
# global zshrc.
#
# That way, we enable people on other operating systems to use our
# setup, too, just by copying our global zshrc to their ${HOME}/.zshrc.
# Adjustments would still go to the .zshrc.local file.
