" All system-wide defaults are set in $VIMRUNTIME/debian.vim (usually just
" /usr/share/vim/vimcurrent/debian.vim) and sourced by the call to :runtime you
" can find below.  If you wish to change any of those settings, you should do it
" in the file /etc/vim/vimrc.local, since debian.vim will be overwritten
" everytime an upgrade of the vim packages is performed and this file
" (/etc/vim/vimrc) every time the package grml-etc-core is upgraded.  It is
" recommended to make changes after sourcing debian.vim since it alters the
" value of the 'compatible' option.

" This line should not be removed as it ensures that various options are
" properly set to work with the Vim-related packages available in Debian.
  runtime! debian.vim

" Uncomment the next line to make Vim more Vi-compatible
" NOTE: debian.vim sets 'nocompatible', but only if debian.vim is available,
" so let's make sure we run in nocompatible mode:
  set nocompatible

" Setting 'compatible' changes numerous
" options, so any other options should be set AFTER setting 'compatible'.
" set compatible

  set backspace=indent,eol,start        " more powerful backspacing

" Now we set some defaults for the editor
  set autoindent        " always set autoindenting on
" set linebreak         " Don't wrap words by default
  set textwidth=0       " Don't wrap lines by default
  set nobackup          " Don't keep a backup file
  set backupcopy=no     " grml: Overwrite files/links with w!
" set backupcopy=yes    " Keep a backup file
  set viminfo='20,\"50  " read/write a .viminfo file, don't store more than
                        " 50 lines of registers
  set history=50        " keep 50 lines of command line history
  set ruler             " show the cursor position all the time

" Suffixes that get lower priority when doing tab completion for filenames.
" These are files we are not likely to want to edit or read.
  set suffixes=.bak,~,.swp,.o,.info,.aux,.log,.dvi,.bbl,.blg,.brf,.cb,.ind,.idx,.ilg,.inx,.out,.toc

" Vim5 and later versions support syntax highlighting.
" Just load the main syntax file when Vim was compiled with "+syntax".
  if has("syntax")

" Debian uses compressed helpfiles. We must inform vim that the main
" helpfiles is compressed. Other helpfiles are stated in the tags-file.

" If using a dark background within the editing area and syntax highlighting
" turn on this option as well

" reopening a file
" if has("autocmd")
"   au BufReadPost * if line("'\"") > 0 && line("'\"") <= line("$")
"     \| exe "normal g'\"" | endif

" Uncomment the following to have Vim load indentation rules according to the
" detected filetype. Per default Debian Vim only load filetype specific
" plugins.
  if has("autocmd")

" The following are commented out as they cause vim to behave a lot
" differently from regular Vi. They are highly recommended though.
  set showcmd           " Show (partial) command in status line.
  set showmatch         " Show matching brackets.
" set ignorecase        " Do case insensitive matching

" set incsearch         " Incremental search
" set autowrite         " Automatically save before commands like :next and :make
" When switching between different buffers you can't use undo without 'set hidden':

" set mouse=a           " Enable mouse usage (all modes) in terminals
