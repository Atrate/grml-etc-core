" All system-wide defaults are set in $VIMRUNTIME/debian.vim (usually just
" /usr/share/vim/vimcurrent/debian.vim) and sourced by the call to :runtime you
" can find below.  If you wish to change any of those settings, you should do it
" in the file /etc/vim/vimrc.local, since debian.vim will be overwritten
" everytime an upgrade of the vim packages is performed and this file
" (/etc/vim/vimrc) every time the package grml-etc is upgraded.  It is
" recommended to make changes after sourcing debian.vim since it alters the
" value of the 'compatible' option.

" This line should not be removed as it ensures that various options are
" properly set to work with the Vim-related packages available in Debian.
runtime! debian.vim

" Uncomment the next line to make Vim more Vi-compatible
" NOTE: debian.vim sets 'nocompatible'.  Setting 'compatible' changes numerous
" options, so any other options should be set AFTER setting 'compatible'.
"set compatible

set backspace=indent,eol,start	" more powerful backspacing

" Now we set some defaults for the editor
set autoindent		" always set autoindenting on
" set linebreak		" Don't wrap words by default
set textwidth=0		" Don't wrap lines by default
set nobackup		" Don't keep a backup file
set backupcopy=no	" grml: Overwrite files/links with w!
" set backupcopy=yes	" Keep a backup file
set viminfo='20,\"50	" read/write a .viminfo file, don't store more than
			" 50 lines of registers
set history=50		" keep 50 lines of command line history
set ruler		" show the cursor position all the time

" Suffixes that get lower priority when doing tab completion for filenames.
" These are files we are not likely to want to edit or read.
set suffixes=.bak,~,.swp,.o,.info,.aux,.log,.dvi,.bbl,.blg,.brf,.cb,.ind,.idx,.ilg,.inx,.out,.toc

" Make p in Visual mode replace the selected text with the "" register.
vnoremap p <Esc>:let current_reg = @"<CR>gvdi<C-R>=current_reg<CR><Esc>

" Vim5 and later versions support syntax highlighting. Uncommenting the next
" line enables syntax highlighting by default.

" Debian uses compressed helpfiles. We must inform vim that the main
" helpfiles is compressed. Other helpfiles are stated in the tags-file.

" detected filetype. Per default Debian Vim only load filetype specific
" plugins.
"if has("autocmd")
"  filetype indent on

" The following are commented out as they cause vim to behave a lot
" differently from regular Vi. They are highly recommended though.
  set showcmd		" Show (partial) command in status line.
